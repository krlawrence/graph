This folder contains the GraphML file for the air-routes graph. This air-routes graph is referenced throughout the book.

Two files are provided. The file air-routes.graphml contains the full graph. The file air-routes-small.graphml just has routes between 46 airports all located in the US.

The small script called *'load-air-routes-graph.groovy'* can be used to load the graph into a TinkerGraph from within the Gremlin Console. Edit the script before using it to adjust the location of where you put the GraphML file on your system.

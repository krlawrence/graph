## Welcome!

This repository is the home for the source materials, sample code and examples for the book "Practical Gremlin - An Apache TinkerPop Tutorial". This is also the home for the `air-routes` dataset referenced throughout the book and samples.

**Quick Start - the latest version**  

To read the latest snapshot of the book right away in a browser (HTML format) click [here](http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/PracticalGremlin.html) or for a PDF version click [here](http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/PracticalGremlin.pdf). These snapshots are updated regularly. You will find other formats including MOBI, EPUB and XML (Docbook) in the [releases](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/releases)  section. Formal releases will be published periodically assuming there is enough new material to make it worthwhile. If you want to see the absolute latest updates you can always browse the Asciidoc source files (Practical-Gremlin.adoc and Section-*.adoc files) in the /book folder. The PDF version is currently the "official" version. It has a better table of contents, some better formatting and a much nicer title page!

**LATEST NEWS:**  
- [Sep-23-2023] Work has started on a second edition of the book! See the note below for more details.
- [Sep-22-2023] Added a script to the sample-data folder for producing Cypher versions of the air-routes data.  
- [Aug-29-2022] Updated versions of the sample data and corresponding demo apps have been uploaded. 

### Work has begun on the second edition!

September 23rd 2023

Ever since I began working on Practical Gremlin, I viewed it as a living book, and have tried to keep up with new features and changes taking place at Apache TinkerPop, updating the manuscript as TinkerPop and Gremlin evolve. However, and this is great to see, the rate and pace at which new features are appearing in Gremlin has steadily increased over the years. This has made it hard to keep up in a "living book" fashion. Moreover, some of the material currently in Practical Gremlin discusses features and limitations in the language that have since either been improved or deprecated. It's really time to start work on a second edition.  I'm excited to announce that [Stephen Mallette](https://github.com/spmallette) has graciously offered to help with this task. We have created a [V1](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/v1) branch which archives the first edition progress. Work for the second edition will simply occur on the default branch. Many of the new Gremlin features that need adding to the manuscript are captured in a [tracking issue](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/issues/115) and there is also a [planning board](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/projects/2#) that we will continue to be used as a way to organize the work ahead. I'm really looking forward to the collaboration with Stephen, and to the production of a fully up-to-date second edition of Practical Gremlin. Please keep an eye on the latest news section here for more updates.

## Releases and change history

The most recent changes and additions are now being tracked in the [change history](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/blob/main/ChangeHistory.md) file.

**A Special note about releases**

Starting with revision 274 (Dec 24 2017), all of the output files (XML, EPUB, MOBI, HTML and PDF) will now be stored using Git releases. Going forward, this should reduce the amount of disk space required for people who create forks of this project. The release notes and downloadable materials are located [here](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/releases).

NOTE: In order to prune the unwanted files from the project the commit history for the output files had to be removed as part of making the v274 release. If you had previously cloned or forked this project please create a new clone or fork. Sorry for the inconvenience but this will get you back approximately 60% (27+ mb) of the disk space that was being taken up and will help anyone else making a clone.


Details of how to build the various output formats from the Asciidoc source are contained in the README.md under the *book* folder.

## How this book came to be

I forget exactly when, but over a year ago I started compiling a list of notes, hints and tips, initially  for my own benefit, of things I had found poorly explained elsewhere while using graph databases and especially using Apache TinkerPop, Janus Graph and Gremlin. Over time that document grew (and continues to grow) and has effectively become a book. After some encouragement from colleagues I have decided to release it as a living book in an open source venue so that anyone who is interested can read it. It is aimed at programmers and  anyone using the Gremlin query language to work with graphs. Lots of code examples, sample queries,  discussion of best practices, lessons I learned the hard way etc. are included.

While this book remains a work in progress, indeed some sections are still to be filled in, I think there is enough here that people may find it a useful aid to learning the Gremlin graph traversal and query language.

Thanks to all those that have encouraged me to keep going with this adventure!

## Introduction

**This book is a work in progress. Feedback (ideally via issue) is very much encouraged and welcomed!**

The title of this book could equally well be "A getting started guide for users of graph databases and the Gremlin query language featuring hints, tips and sample queries". It turns out that is a bit too too long to fit on one line for a heading but in a single sentence that describes the focus of this book pretty well.

The book introduces the Apache TinkerPop 3 Gremlin graph query and traversal language via real examples against a real world graph. They are given as a set of working examples against a graph that is also provided in the sample-data folder. The graph, air-routes.graphml, is a model of the world airline route network between 3,367 airports including 43,160 routes. The examples we present will work unmodified with the air-routes.graphml file loaded into the Gremlin console running with a TinkerGraph.

## How this site is organized

The book is being written using a text editor in AsciiDoc format. The source manuscript "Practical-Gremlin.adoc" can be found in the /book folder. These files always reflect the most recent updates and will often be ahead of the other formats that are only updated as part of a formal release. You will find formatted HTML and PDF versions of the book in the releases area. Formal releases also include DOCBOOK, EPUB and MOBI versions. These can be viewed using many tools and e-book readers. Note that currently, only the HTML and PDF versions have all the nice colors for source code listings etc.

Included with the book are sample graph data (GraphML) and program files. You will find these, as well as some screen shots and images, and demos in the following folders.

- /book
- /sample-data
- /sample-code
- /images
- /demos

The air-routes data set, along with tools to manipulate it and generate different file formats, is located here:

- /make-route-graph
  
## How the book is organized
This is the current layout of the second edition. As work progresses additional chapters
may be added and the layout further refined.

Chapter 1 - INTRODUCTION
- We start our journey with a brief introduction to Apache Tinkerpop and a quick look
  at why Graph databases are of interest to us. We also discuss how the book is
  organized and where to find additional materials; such as sample code and data
  sets. 

Chapter 2 - GETTING STARTED
- Many of the examples throughout the book use the Gremlin Console and TinkerGraph,
  and both are introduced in this chapter. We also introduce the air-routes example
  graph - `air-routes.graphml` -  used throughout the book.

Chapter 3 - WRITING GREMLIN QUERIES
- Now that the basics have been covered, things start to get a lot more interesting!
  It's time to start writing Gremlin queries. We
  briefly explore how we could have built the 'air-routes' graph using a
  relational database, and then look at how SQL and Gremlin are both similar in some
  way,s and very different in others. We then introduce several of the key Gremlin
  query language '"steps"'. We focus on exploring the graph rather than changing it
  in this chapter.

Chapter 4 - BEYOND BASIC QUERIES
- Having now introduced Gremlin in some detail, we introduce the Gremlin steps that
  can be used to create, modify, and delete, data. We present a selection of best
  practices and start to explore some more advanced query writing.

Chapter 5 - MISCELLANEOUS QUERIES AND THE RESULTS THEY GENERATE
- Using the Gremlin steps introduced in Chapters 3 and 4, we are now ready to use
  what we have learned so far and write queries that analyze the air-routes graph in
  more depth, and answer more complicated questions. The material presented includes
  a discussion of analyzing distances, route distribution, and writing geospatial
  queries.

Chapter 6 - MOVING BEYOND THE GREMLIN CONSOLE
- The next step in our journey is to move beyond the Gremlin console and take a look
  at interacting with a TinkerGraph using Java and Groovy applications.

Chapter 7 - INTRODUCING JANUS GRAPH
- As we continue the journey beyond the Gremlin Console, we now also move beyond
  TinkerGraph. This chapter introduces JanusGraph and includes a discussion of
  defining schema, managing trabsactions, and different storage and indexing options.

Chapter 8 - INTRODUCING GREMLIN SERVER
- Our journey so far has focussed on working with graphs in a "directly attached"
  fashion. We now introduce Gremlin Server as a way to deploy and interact with
  remotely hosted graphs.

Chapter 9 - COMMON GRAPH SERIALIZATION FORMATS
- Having introduced Gremlin Server we take a look at some common Graph serialization
  file formats along with coverage of how to use them in the context of TinkerPop
  enabled graphs. We take a close look at the TinkerPop GraphSON (JSON) format which
  is  used extensively when using Gremlin queries in conjunction with a Gremlin
  Server.

Chapter 10 - FURTHER READING
- Our journey to explore Apache TinkerPop and Gremlin concludes with a look at
  useful sources of further reading. We present l links to useful web sites where you
  can find tools and documentation for many of the topics and technologies covered in
  this book.

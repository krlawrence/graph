# Change History

Starting with the v275 release, this file will contain a record of the major changes and updates made in each release.

## Release V2-001 change history (Release date TBD)
_This will be the first release of work related to the Second Edition  ( [main branch](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/main) ) work._ The original First Edition work can still be found  on the [v1 branch](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/v1) .

- Changes to the site layout and toolchain
  - The default branch is now called [main](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph).
  - The First Edition work has been moved to the [v1](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/v1) branch.
  - Split the single (big) asciidoc file into multiple files with one file per major section.
- Structural changes to the book
  - Removed specific mentions of early TinkerPop versions. The Second Edition will focus on Gremlin as it is today (after many years of evolution). 

## Release 283 change history (Release date TBD)

_This will be the final release of work related to the First Edition ( [v1 branch](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/v1) ). Moving forward new work will focus on the Second Edition ( [main branch](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/main) ) work._

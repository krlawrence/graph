## About the files in this folder
This folder contains the AsciiDoc source files used to produce the HTML, XML (DOCBOOK), EPUB, MOBI and PDF output.

The `Practical-Gremlin.adoc` file contains links to the different sections of the book. The names of the other AsciiDoc format files follow the naming convention : __*Section-\*.adoc*__. You can browse `Practical-Gremlin.adoc` and the various 'Section-\*.adoc' files directly from within GitHub, but you will not get the full color coding, chapter numbering, and other niceties that are present in the HTML and PDF versions; as they have been run through an AsciiDoc processor and had various style sheets and code pretty printers applied. Your mileage may vary, but I find the HTML and PDF versions to be the most pleasing to read. The PDF version includes page numbers, the HTML version is one continuous document. 

The '.adoc' files in this folder represent the most recent updates and may not have been published elsewhere yet, even in preview form. The other formats (HTML,DocBook,PDF,ePub and MOBI) will be generated once there are enough updates to make it worthwhile creating a full release. 

## Building the book
If you want to build the output format files yourself they can be generated by running the `make-book.sh` script. The script assumes you have Asciidoctor installed (which is a Ruby Gem) as well as Pygments.rb (another Ruby Gem). The tools can be installed using various package managers and are available on most, commonly used, desktop operating system platforms.

To do the conversion to MOBI and EPUB the script assumes that Calibre and Pandoc are installed. I have successfully built the book on several Linux distros including Ubuntu, CentOS and Red Hat. I have successfully used Asciidoctor on Mac OS as well, but I always use Linux to produce the EPUB abd MOBI versions.

### Building the HTML version
```
asciidoctor Practical-Gremlin.adoc
```

### Building the PDF version
```
asciidoctor-pdf Practical-Gremlin.adoc
```

### Building additional versions
The XML (DOCBOOK) file is generated using Asciidoctor and can be viewed on Linux using the Yelp tool among many others or used to produce other formats. The EPUB and MOBI files can be viewed using most popular e-book readers and some browsers. 

Please note that the DOCBOOK, EPUB and MOBI format files currently do not have all of the nice source code highlighting and colors that the HTML and PDF versions have.

```
# Docbook / XML
asciidoctor -n -b docbook -d book Practical-Gremlin.adoc -o krltemp.xml
sed -e s/language=\"groovy\"/language=\"java\"/ krltemp.xml > Practical-Gremlin.xml
rm krltemp.xml

# EPUB
pandoc -f docbook -t epub -N --number-sections --top-level-division=chapter --toc --toc-depth=4 Practical-Gremlin.xml -o Practical-Gremlin.epub

# MOBI
ebook-convert Practical-Gremlin.epub Practical-Gremlin.mobi

```

## Preview releases

Preview versions of the book in HTML are automatically published [here](https://krlawrence.github.io/graph/) as changes arrive to the `main` branch of the repository. 

## How the book is organized
This is the current layout of the second edition. As work progresses additional chapters
may be added and the layout further refined.

**Chapter 1 - INTRODUCTION**
- We start our journey with a brief introduction to Apache Tinkerpop and a quick look
  at why Graph databases are of interest to us. We also discuss how the book is
  organized and where to find additional materials; such as sample code and data
  sets. 

**Chapter 2 - GETTING STARTED**
- Many of the examples throughout the book use the Gremlin Console and TinkerGraph,
  and both are introduced in this chapter. We also introduce the air-routes example
  graph - `air-routes.graphml` -  used throughout the book.

**Chapter 3 - WRITING GREMLIN QUERIES**
- Now that the basics have been covered, things start to get a lot more interesting!
  It's time to start writing Gremlin queries. We
  briefly explore how we could have built the 'air-routes' graph using a
  relational database, and then look at how SQL and Gremlin are both similar in some
  way,s and very different in others. We then introduce several of the key Gremlin
  query language '"steps"'. We focus on exploring the graph rather than changing it
  in this chapter.

**Chapter 4 - BEYOND BASIC QUERIES**
- Having now introduced Gremlin in some detail, we introduce the Gremlin steps that
  can be used to create, modify, and delete, data. We present a selection of best
  practices and start to explore some more advanced query writing.

**Chapter 5 - MISCELLANEOUS QUERIES AND THE RESULTS THEY GENERATE**
- Using the Gremlin steps introduced in Chapters 3 and 4, we are now ready to use
  what we have learned so far and write queries that analyze the air-routes graph in
  more depth, and answer more complicated questions. The material presented includes
  a discussion of analyzing distances, route distribution, and writing geospatial
  queries.

**Chapter 6 - MOVING BEYOND THE GREMLIN CONSOLE**
- The next step in our journey is to move beyond the Gremlin console and take a look
  at interacting with a TinkerGraph using Java and Groovy applications.

**Chapter 7 - INTRODUCING JANUSGRAPH**
- As we continue the journey beyond the Gremlin Console, we now also move beyond
  TinkerGraph. This chapter introduces JanusGraph and includes a discussion of
  defining schema, managing transactions, and different storage and indexing options.

**Chapter 8 - INTRODUCING GREMLIN SERVER**
- Our journey so far has focussed on working with graphs in a "directly attached"
  fashion. We now introduce Gremlin Server as a way to deploy and interact with
  remotely hosted graphs.

**Chapter 9 - COMMON GRAPH SERIALIZATION FORMATS**
- Having introduced Gremlin Server we take a look at some common Graph serialization
  file formats along with coverage of how to use them in the context of TinkerPop
  enabled graphs. We take a close look at the TinkerPop GraphSON (JSON) format which
  is  used extensively when using Gremlin queries in conjunction with a Gremlin
  Server.

**Chapter 10 - FURTHER READING**
- Our journey to explore Apache TinkerPop and Gremlin concludes with a look at
  useful sources of further reading. We present l links to useful web sites where you
  can find tools and documentation for many of the topics and technologies covered in
  this book.

This folder contains the AsciiDoc source file used to produce the HTML, XML (DOCBOOK), EPUB, MOBI and PDF output.


**LATEST NEWS:**  
- [Sep-23-2023] Work has started on a second edition of the book! See the note below for more details.
- [Apr-2-2023] Many exciting new features have been added to TinkerPop/Gremlin in the 3.6.x line of updates. This will require quite a few updates to the manuscript. As a start, two tracking issues are being used for the key features that need adding - see [#115](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/issues/115) and [#240](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/issues/240). These issues include updates from both the 3.5.x and 3.6.x lines.
- [May-4-2022] The latest preview draft of revision 283 (TP 3.5.2) is now available in HTML and PDF versions. See [change history](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/blob/master/ChangeHistory.md) for details.  
- [Oct-26-2019] Revision 282 (TP 3.4.4) was just published in all formats. See [change history](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/blob/master/ChangeHistory.md) for details.   

### Work has begun on the second edition!

September 23rd 2023

Ever since I began working on Practical Gremlin, I viewed it as a living book, and have tried to keep up with new features and changes taking place at Apache TinkerPop, updating the manuscript as TinkerPop and Gremlin evolve. However, and this is great to see, the rate and pace at which new features are appearing in Gremlin has steadily increased over the years. This has made it hard to keep up in a "living book" fashion. Moreover, some of the material currently in Practical Gremlin discusses features and limitations in the language that have since either been improved or deprecated. It's really time to start work on a second edition. I'm excited to annuonce that [Stephen Mallette](https://github.com/spmallette) has graciously offered to help with this task. We have created a [V2](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/v2) branch and will do most of the second edition work there. Over time, the current mainline branch will be archived, and the V2 branch will become the main one. Many of the new Gremlin features that need adding to the manuscript are captured in a [tracking issue](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/issues/115) and there is also a [planning board](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/projects/2#) that we will continue to be used as a way to organize the work ahead. I'm really looking forward to the collaboration with Stephen, and to the production of a fully up to date second edition of Practical Gremlin. Please keep an eye on the latest news section here for more updates.  

## Releases and change history

The most recent changes and additions are now being tracked in the [change history](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/blob/master/ChangeHistory.md) file.

**A special note about releases**

Starting with revision 274 (Dec 24 2017), all of the output files (XML, EPUB, MOBI, HTML and PDF) will now be stored using Git releases. Going forward, this should reduce the amount of disk space required for people who create forks of this project. The releases are located [here](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/releases).

NOTE: In order to prune the unwanted files from the project, as part of the v274 release,  the commit history for the output files had to be removed. If you had previously cloned or forked this project please create a new clone or fork. Sorry for the inconvenience but this will get you back approximately 60% (27+ mb) of the disk space that was being taken up and will help anyone else making a clone.

**About the files in this folder**

You can browse the 'Gremlin-Graph-Guide.adoc' file directly from within the GitHub (web interface) and it will work but you will not get the full color coding and other niceties that are present in the HTML and PDF versions as they have been run through an AsciiDoc processor and had various style sheets and code pretty printers applied. Your mileage may vary but I find the HTML version to be the most pleasing to read. The '.adoc' file will always contain the most recent updates. The other formats (HTML,DocBook,PDF,ePub and MOBI) will be generated once there are enough updates to make it worthwhile generating a 'release'. If you want to build the output format files yourself they can be generated by running the 'make-book.sh' script. The script assumes you have Asciidoctor installed (which is a Ruby Gem) as well as Pygments.rb (another Ruby Gem). To do the conversion to MOBI and EPUB the script assumes that Calibre and Pandoc are installed. I have successfuly built the book on several Linux distros including Ubuntu, CentOS and Red Hat. I have successfully used Asciidoctor on Mac OS as well but I always use Linux to produce the EPUB abd MOBI versions.

To read the HTML file please either downloaded it to your computer or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/PracticalGremlin.html as it is too big for Git to display inside its web user interface. 

To view the PDF please either download it and use a PDF viewer or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/PracticalGremlin.pdf

The XML (DOCBOOK) file is generated using Asciidoctor and can be viewed on Linux using the Yelp tool among many others or used to produce other formats. The EPUB and MOBI files can be viewed using most popular e-book readers and some browsers.

Please note that the DOCBOOK, EPUB and MOBI format files currently do not have all of the nice source code highlighting and colors that the HTML and PDF versions have.

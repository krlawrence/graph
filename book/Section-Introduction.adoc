Welcome to the second edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Practical Gremlin was first published in 2017. In the years that followed, the Apache
TinkerPop graph computing framework has continued to evolve.  While it was possible
to keep the first edition mostly up to date, and to publish periodic updates, there
comes a time when so much has changed that it makes more sense to take a step back,
and release a second edition. The book has been updated to include the most recent
new features added to the Gremlin query language and related technologies. Material
such as discussions of migrating from old versions of Gremlin, and discussions of how
to work around features then lacking, but since added, have been removed. The
following paragraph was used to introduce the first edition. It remains as true today
as it was then. 

[quote, Practical Gremlin first edition, October 2017]
____
The title of this book could equally well be '"A getting started
guide for users of graph databases and the Gremlin query language featuring hints,
tips and sample queries"'. It turns out that is a bit too long to fit on one line for
a heading but in a single sentence that describes the focus of this work pretty well.
____

As with the first edition, I have resisted the urge to cover every single feature of
TinkerPop one after the other in a reference manual fashion. Instead, what I have
tried to do is capture the learning process that I myself have gone through using
what I hope is a sensible flow from getting started to more advanced topics. To get
the most from this book I recommend having the Gremlin console open, with the air
route sample data loaded, as you follow along. I have not assumed that anyone reading
this book has any prior knowledge of Apache TinkerPop, the Gremlin query language or
related tools.  Everything you need to get started is introduced in Chapter 2.

I hope people continue to find what follows useful. It definitely remains a work in
progress as the Apache TinkerPop framework, and in particular, the Gremlin query
language, continues to evolve.

The book is available in multiple formats including PDF, HTML, ePub and MOBI. Those
versions, along with sample code and data, can be found at the
https://github.com/krlawrence/graph[project's home on GitHub]. You will find a
summary of everything that is available in the "<<samplesintro>>" section.

How this book came to be
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I forget exactly when, but sometime early in 2016 I started compiling a list of
notes, hints and tips, initially for my own benefit. My notes were full of things I
had found poorly explained elsewhere while using graph databases and especially while
using Apache TinkerPop, Gremlin and JanusGraph. Over time that document continued to
grow and had effectively become a book in all but name. After some encouragement from
colleagues I decided to release my notes as a 'living book' in an open source venue
so that anyone who is interested can read it. It is definitely aimed at programmers
and data scientists but I hope is also consumable by anyone using the Gremlin graph
query and traversal language to work with graph databases.

I have included a large number of code examples and sample queries along with
discussions of best practices and more than a few lessons I learned the hard way,
that I hope you will find informative. I call it a 'living book' as my goal is to
regularly make updates as I discover things that need adding while also trying to
keep the content as up to date as possible as Apache TinkerPop itself evolves.

I remain extremely grateful to all those who have encouraged me to keep going with
this adventure. Keeping up with a moving target requires a fair bit of work, but
remains a lot of fun!

[[thanks]]
Some words of thanks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I would like to thank my former colleagues, Graham Wallis, Jason Plurad and Adam
Holley for their help in refining and improving several of the queries contained in
this book. Gremlin is definitely a bit of a team sport. We spent many fun hours
discussing the best way to handle different types of queries and traversals!

I would also be remiss if I did not give a big shout out to all of the folks that
spend a lot of time replying to questions and suggestions on the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gremlin-users[Gremlin Users Google Group].
Special thanks should go to Daniel Kuppitz, Marko Rodriguez and Stephen Mallette, key
members of the team that created and maintains Apache TinkerPop.

Lastly, I would like to thank everyone who has submitted feedback and ideas via
e-mail as well as GitHub issues and pull requests. That is the best part about this
being a 'living book' we can continue to improve and evolve it just as the technology
it is about continues to evolve. Your help and support is very much appreciated.

[[about]]
What is this book about?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book introduces the Apache TinkerPop 'Gremlin' graph query and traversal
language via real examples featuring real-world graph data. That data along with
sample code and example applications is available for download from the GitHub
project as well as many other items. The graph, 'air-routes', is a model of
the world airline route network between 3,373 airports including 43,400 routes. The
examples presented will work unmodified with the `air-routes.graphml` file loaded into
the Gremlin console running with a TinkerGraph. How to set that environment up is
covered in the <<gremlininstall>> section below.

NOTE: The examples in this book have been tested using Apache TinkerPop release
{tpvercheck}.

TinkerGraph is an 'in-memory' graph, meaning nothing gets saved to disk
automatically. It is included as part of the Apache TinkerPop download. The goal of
this tutorial is to allow someone with little to no prior knowledge, to get up and
going quickly using the Gremlin Console and the 'air-routes' graph. Later in the book
we discuss using additional technologies such as JanusGraph, Apache Cassandra,
Gremlin Server and Elastic Search. These capabilities enable the creation of scalable
and persisted graph stores that can still be explored using Gremlin queries. Writing
standalone applications in languages such as Java, Groovy, and Python is also covered
in the later chapters.

NOTE: The first few sections of the book focus on showing some basic Gremlin queries
that are both useful and yet easy to understand. By the end of Chapter 3 you should
have a basic understanding of how to explore the air routes graph using commonly used
Gremlin steps. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 explore Gremlin in more depth.


.How this book is organized
Chapter 1 - INTRODUCTION::
- I start off by briefly doing a recap on why Graph databases are of interest to us
and discuss some good use cases for graphs. I also provide pointers to the sample
programs and other additional materials referenced by the book.
Chapter 2 - GETTING STARTED::
- In Chapter two I introduce several of the components of Apache TinkerPop and
also introduce the `air-routes.graphml` file that will be used as the graph the
majority of examples shown in this book are based on.
Chapter 3 - WRITING GREMLIN QUERIES::
- In Chapter three things start to get a lot more interesting! I start discussing
how to use the Gremlin graph traversal and
query language to interrogate the 'air-routes' graph. I begin by comparing how we
could have built the 'air-routes' graph using a more traditional relational database
and then look at how SQL and Gremlin are both similar in some ways and very
different in others. For the rest of the Chapter, I introduce several of
the key Gremlin methods, or as they are often called, '"steps"'. I
mostly focus on reading the graph (not adding or deleting things) in this Chapter.
Chapter 4 - BEYOND BASIC QUERIES::
- In Chapter four the focus moves beyond just reading the graph and I describe how to add
vertices (nodes), edges and properties as well as how to delete and update them.
I also present a discussion of various best practices. I also start to explore
some slightly more advanced topics in this chapter.
Chapter 5 - MISCELLANEOUS QUERIES AND THE RESULTS THEY GENERATE::
- In Chapter five I focus on using what has been covered in the prior Chapters to write
queries that have a more real-world feel. I present a lot more examples of the
output from running queries in this Chapter. I also start to discuss topics such
as analyzing distances, route distribution and writing geospatial queries.
Chapter 6 - MOVING BEYOND THE CONSOLE AND TINKERGRAPH::
- In Chapter six I start to expand the focus to concepts beyond using the Gremlin
Console and a TinkerGraph. I
start by looking at how you can write standalone Java and Groovy applications that
can work with a graph. I then introduce JanusGraph and take a fairly detailed
look at its capabilities such as support for transactions, schemas and indexes.
Various technology choices for back end persistent stores
and indexes are explored along the way.
Chapter 7 - INTRODUCING GREMLIN SERVER::
- In Chapter seven, Gremlin Server is introduced. I begin to explore connecting to
and working with a remote graph both from the Gremlin Console and the command line
as well as from code. When this book was first released, the majority of "real
world" use cases
focussed on directly attached or even in memory graphs. As Apache TinkerPop has
evolved, it has become a lot more common to connect to a graph remotely via a
Gremlin Server.
Chapter 8 - COMMON GRAPH SERIALIZATION FORMATS::
- In Chapter eight a discussion is presented of some common Graph serialization file
formats along with coverage of how to use them in the context of TinkerPop enabled
graphs.
Chapter 9 - FURTHER READING::
- I finish up by providing several links to useful web sites where you can find
tools and documentation for many of the topics and technologies covered in this book.

[[samplesintro]]
Introducing the book sources, sample programs and data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All work related to this project is being done in the open at GitHub. A list of where
to find the key components is provided below. The examples in this book make use of a
sample graph called 'air-routes' which contains a graph based on the world airline
route network between over 3,370 airports. The sample graph data, quite a bit of
sample code and some larger demo applications can all be found at the same GitHub
location that hosts the book manuscript. You will also find releases of the book
in various formats (HTML, PDF, DocBook/XML, MOBI and EPUB) at the same GitHub
location. The sample programs include standalone Java, Groovy, Python and Ruby
examples as well as many examples that can be run from the Gremlin Console. There
are some differences between using Gremlin from a standalone program and from the
Gremlin Console. The sample programs demonstrate several of these differences. The
sample applications area contains a full example HTML and JavaScript application that
lets you explore the 'air-routes' graph visually. The home page for the GitHub
project includes a README.md file to help you navigate the site. Below are some links
to various resources included with this book.

.Where to find the book, samples and data
Project home::
- https://github.com/krlawrence/graph
Book manuscript in Asciidoc format::
- This file can be viewed using the GitHub web interface. It will always represent
the very latest updates.
- https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/tree/main/book
Latest PDF and HTML snapshots::
- These files are regularly updated to reflect any significant changes. These are the
only generated formats that are updated outside of the full release cycle. The PDF
version includes pagination as well as page numbering and is produced using an A4
page size. The HTML version does not include these features. Otherwise they are
more or less identical.
- http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/PracticalGremlin.pdf
- http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/PracticalGremlin.html
Official book releases in multiple formats::
- Official releases include Asciidoc, HTML, PDF, ePub, MOBI and DocBook versions as
well as snapshots of all the samples and other materials in a single package. My
goal is to have an official release about once a month providing enough new
material has been created to justify doing it. The eBook and MOBI versions are
really intended to be read using e-reader devices and for that reason use a white
background for all source code highlighting to make it easier to read on monochrome
devices.
- I recommend using the PDF version if possible as it has page numbering. If
you prefer reading the book as if it were web page then by all means use the HTML
version. You will just not get any pagination or page numbers. The DocBook format
can be read using tools such as Yelp on Linux systems but is primarily included
so that people can use it to generate other formats that I do not already provide.
There is currently an issue with the MOBI and ePub versions that causes links to
have the wrong text. Other than that they should work although you may need to
change the font size you use on your device to make things easier to read.

[[tp34intro]]
A word about TinkerPop 3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A major update to Apache TinkerPop, version 3.4.0, was released in January 2019 and a
number of point releases followed. The examples in this book have been tested with
all releases of the 3.4.x line. New examples have also been added as necessitated by
those updates.

NOTE: The change history contains details of everything that has been added over time
and can be found at this location:
https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/blob/main/ChangeHistory.md

Graph database engines that support Apache TinkerPop often take a while to move up to
new releases and it's always a good idea to verify the exact level the database you are
using supports.

NOTE: Full details of all the new features added in the TinkerPop 3.4.x releases can be
found at the following link:
https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.asciidoc

As well as updating the book, I continue incrementally adding coverage of these
features to the `sample-code` folder. Samples currently added include
`nested-repeat.groovy` that demonstrates the use of the new nested repeat step
capability. It can be loaded and run from the Gremlin console.

[[tp35intro]]
Introducing TinkerPop 3.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apache TinkerPop 3.5.0 was released in May 2021. This update introduced a number of
improvements in areas such as Gremlin client drivers, the Gremlin Server and overall
bug fixes. The release also improved the Gremlin query language in some key areas.
Some features that had been declared deprecated in earlier releases were finally
removed as part of the 3.5.0 update. If you have queries and code that still use
these deprecated features, as part of an upgrade to the 3.5.x level, you will need to
make the appropriate changes.

The main breaking change to be aware of is that 'Order.incr' and 'Order.decr' were
removed from the Gremlin language. The newer 'Order.asc' and 'Order.desc' must be
used instead. The examples in this book and those in the `sample-code` folder have
been updated to reflect these changes.

In January 2022, the TinkerPop 3.5.2 release added a native `datetime` operator to
the Gremlin language such that dates can be added without needing programming
language specific constructs. This is useful when sending Gremlin queries as text
strings.

NOTE: Full details of all the new features added in the TinkerPop 3.5.x releases can be
found at the following link:
https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.asciidoc

[[tp36intro]]
Introducing TinkerPop 3.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apache TinkerPop 3.6.0 was released in April 2022. Coming almost exactly a year after
the initial 3.5.0 release, this is one of the most significant TinkerPop releases
since TinkerPop 3.4.0 appeared in January 2019. The release contains many
improvements, including several new Gremlin steps, designed to make commonly
performed tasks much easier. Notable improvements include:

- New 'mergeV' and 'mergeE' steps that make "create if not exist"
type queries, sometimes referred to as "upserts", much easier to write. Over time,
these steps will replace use of the 'fold...coalesce' pattern, and will also
replace the various "map injection" patterns that can be used to create multiple
vertices and edges in a single query.
- A new 'TextP.regex' predicate that allows regular expressions to be
used when comparing strings.
- The 'property' step can now be given a map of key/value pairs so that several
properties can be created at once.
- A new 'element' step that can be used to find the parent element (vertex or edge)
of a property.
- A new 'call' step that lays the foundation enabling Gremlin queries to call other
endpoints. This opens up many types of interesting use cases such as query
federation, and looking up values from other services.
- A lot of effort has been put into removing unnecessary exceptions by filtering out
parts of traversals instead of failing with an error. This is especially so in the
case of 'by' modulators that now filter when a value does not exist rather than
throw an exception. This work began as part of the TinkerPop 3.5.2 update and is
completed as of TinkerPop 3.6.0.
- A new 'fail' step that can be used to abort a query in a controlled way.

Over time, new sections will be added to this book that cover each of these features
in detail.

As always, check the level of ApacheTinkerPop the graph database you are using
supports before trying to use these new features.

NOTE: Full details of all the new features added in the TinkerPop 3.6.x releases can be
found at the following link:

[[whygraph]]
So what is a graph database and why should I care?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book is mainly intended to be a tutorial in working with graph databases and
related technology using the Gremlin query language. However, it is worth spending
just a few moments to summarize why it is important to understand what a graph
database is, what some good use cases for graphs are and why you should care in a
world that is already full of all kinds of SQL and NoSQL databases. In this book we
are going to be discussing 'directed property graphs'. At the conceptual level these
types of graphs are quite simple to understand. You have three basic building blocks.
Vertices (often referred to as nodes), edges and properties. Vertices represent
"things" such as people or places. Edges represent connections between those
vertices, and properties are information added to the vertices and edges as needed.
The 'directed' part of the name means that any edge has a direction. It goes 'out'
from one vertex and 'in' to another. You will sometimes hear people use the word
'digraph' as shorthand for 'directed graph'. Consider the relationship "Kelvin knows
Jack". This could be modeled as a vertex for each of the people and an edge for the
relationship as follows.

[.text-center]
Kelvin -- knows -> Jack

Note the arrow which implies the direction of the relationship. If we wanted to
record the fact that Jack also admits to knowing Kelvin we would need to add a
second edge from Jack to Kelvin. Properties could be added to each person to give
more information about them. For example, my age might be a property on my vertex.

It turns out that Jack really likes cats. We might want to store that in our graph as
well so we could create the relationship:

[.text-center]
Jack -- likes -> Cats

Now that we have a bit more in our graph we could answer the question "who does
Kelvin know that likes cats?"

[.text-center]
Kelvin -- knows -> Jack -- likes -> Cats

This is a simple example but hopefully you can already see that we are modelling our
data the way we think about it in the real world. Armed with this knowledge you now
have all of the basic building blocks you need in order to start thinking about how
you might model things you are familiar with as a graph.

So getting back to the question "why should I care?", well, if something looks like a
graph, then wouldn't it be great if we could model it that way. Many things in our
everyday lives center around things that can very nicely be represented in a graph.
Things such as your social and business networks, the route you take to get to work,
the phone network, airline route choices for trips you need to take are all great
candidates. There are also many great business applications for graph databases and
algorithms. These include recommendation systems, crime prevention and fraud
detection to name but three.

The reverse is also true. If something does not feel like a graph then don't try to
force it to be. Your videos are probably doing quite nicely living in the object
store where you currently have them. A sales ledger system built using a relational
database is probably doing just fine where it is and likewise a document store is
quite possibly just the right place to be storing your documents. So "use the right
tool for the job" remains as valid a phrase here as elsewhere. Where graph databases
come into their own is when the data you are storing is intrinsically linked by its
very nature, the air routes network used as the basis for all of the examples in
this book being a perfect example of such a situation.

Those of you that looked at graphs as part of a computer science course are correct
if your reaction was "Surely graphs have been around for ages, why is this considered
new?". Indeed, Leonard Euler is credited with demonstrating the first graph problem
and inventing the whole concept of "Graph Theory" all the way back in 1763 when he
investigated the now famous "Seven Bridges of Koenigsberg" problem.

If you want to read a bit more about graph theory and its present-day application,
you can find a lot of good information online. Here's a Wikipedia link to get you
started: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory

So, given Graph Theory is anything but a new idea, why is it that only recently we
are seeing a massive growth in the building and deployment of graph database systems
and applications? At least part of the answer is that computer hardware and software
has reached the point where you can build large big data systems that scale well for
a reasonable price. In fact, it's even easier than ever to build the large systems
because you don't have to buy the hardware that your system will run on when you use
the cloud.

While you can certainly run a graph database on your laptop--I do just that every
day--the reality is that in production, at scale, they are big data systems. Large
graphs commonly have many billions of vertices and edges in them, taking up petabytes
of data on disk. Graph algorithms can be both compute- and memory-intensive, and it
is only fairly recently that deploying the necessary resources for such big data
systems has made financial sense for more everyday uses in business, and not just in
government or academia. Graph databases are becoming much more broadly adopted across
the spectrum, from high-end scientific research to financial networks and beyond.

Another factor that has really helped start this graph database revolution is the
availability of high-quality open source technology. There are a lot of great open
source projects addressing everything from the databases you need to store the graph
data, to the query languages used to traverse them, all the way up to visually
displaying graphs as part of the user interface layer. In particular, it is so-called
'property graphs' where we are seeing the broadest development and uptake. In a
property graph, both vertices and edges can have properties (effectively, key-value
pairs) associated with them. There are many styles of graph that you may end up
building and there have been whole books written on these various design patterns,
but the property graph technology we will focus on in this book can support
all of the most common usage patterns. If you hear phrases such as 'directed graph'
and 'undirected graph', or 'cyclic' and 'acyclic' graph, and many more as you work
with graph databases, a quick online search will get you to a place where you can get
familiar with that terminology. A deep discussion of these patterns is beyond the
scope of this book, and it's in no way essential to have a full background in
graph theory to get productive quickly.

A third, and equally important, factor in the growth we are seeing in graph database
adoption is the low barrier of entry for programmers. As you will see from the
examples in this book, someone wanting to experiment with graph technology can
download the Apache TinkerPop package and as long as Java 8 is installed, be up and
running with zero configuration (other than doing an unzip of the files), in as
little as five minutes. Graph databases do not force you to define schemas or
specify the layout of tables and columns before you can get going and start building
a graph. Programmers also seem to find the graph style of programming quite
intuitive as it closely models the way they think of the world.

Graph database technology should not be viewed as a "rip and replace" technology, but
as very much complementary to other databases that you may already have deployed. One
common use case is for the graph to be used as a form of smart index into other data
stores. This is sometimes called having a polyglot data architecture.

[[nodevert]]
A word about terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The words 'node' and 'vertex' are synonymous when discussing a graph. Throughout this
book you may find both words used. However, as the Apache TinkerPop documentation
almost exclusively uses the word 'vertex', as much as possible when discussing
Gremlin queries and other concepts, I endeavor to stick to the word 'vertex' or the
plural form 'vertices'. As this book has evolved, I realized my use of these terms had
become inconsistent and as I continue to make updates, I plan, with a few exceptions,
such as when discussing binary trees, to standardize on 'vertex' rather than 'node'.
In that way, this book will be consistent with the official TinkerPop documentation.
Similarly, when discussing the connections between vertices I use the term 'edge' or
the plural form, 'edges'. In other books and articles you may also see terms like
'relationship' or 'arc' used.  Again these terms are synonymous in the context of
graphs.
